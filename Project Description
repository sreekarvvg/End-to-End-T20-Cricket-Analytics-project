# End-to-End-T20-Cricket-Analytics-project


I conducted a comprehensive analysis to select the best 11 players for a T20 cricket team. 
To gather initial data, I utilized software libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and Numpy to collect and extract information from the ESPN Cricinfo website. 
I then used web scraping via Bright Data to obtain more complicated data. 
Once all data was collected, I cleaned and transformed it using the Pandas library. 
Finally, I used Power BI to create visualizations and ultimately build my final team of 11 players.

Please go through the python code to transform and clean the data.
You can download the json files or the csv files for your own visualization.
Please go through the power BI file to either create your visualization or see my powerBI query and Dashboard
